Here one can find python scripts, used for sorting the world sample of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale ITS region sequences. 

The script attributetogenotypes.py compares two fasta files: the dataset "sample.fasta" and file "referenceset.fasta" with reference sequences. The result is the file "attributed.txt", where the first column contains names from "sample.fasta" and the second -- a name from reference dataset, if found
