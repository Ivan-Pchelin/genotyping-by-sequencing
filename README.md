Here one can find python scripts, used for sorting the world sample of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale ITS region sequences. This work was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research [grant number 18-34-00153].

The script attributetogenotypes.py compares two fasta files: the dataset "sample.fasta" and file "referenceset.fasta" with reference sequences. The result is the file "attributed.txt", where the first column contains names from "sample.fasta" and the second -- a name from reference dataset, if found.
